# AL_ML-PROJECTS

Developed a variety of prediction models during Data Science and Machine Learning
Internship to solve various problems in health care, finance, education, and retailing.

Projects included:__
Cancer Prediction__
Chance of Admission Prediction
Credit Card Default Prediction
Fish Weight Prediction
Purchases Prediction

The model above gave high precision because these techniques of data preprocessing, feature
engineering and machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and neural
networks were used.
