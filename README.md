# AL_ML-PROJECTS

Developed a variety of prediction models during to solve various problems in health care, finance, education, and retailing.

Projects included:<br/>
Cancer Prediction<br/>
Chance of Admission Prediction<br/>
Credit Card Default Prediction<br/>
Fish Weight Prediction<br/>
Purchases Prediction

The model above gave high precision because these techniques of data preprocessing, feature
engineering and machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and neural
networks were used.
